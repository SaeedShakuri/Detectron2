# Detectron2
Here, I share a few of my Colab notebooks related to Detectron2 for object detection.
- Dataset registration (To use Detectron2, one needs to register their dataset)
  - Pascal VOC 2007
  - MS COCO 2014
- Data augmentation on datasets (Three different ways)
- Using a pre-trained model on a single image (No training is needed)
- Fine-tuning an object detection model on the Pascal VOC dataset
